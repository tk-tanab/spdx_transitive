PackageComment: <text>"No Tofu" monospaced font family with large Unicode coverage
 Noto is a collection of font families,
 each visually harmonized across scripts.
 .
 This package contains Noto Mono font family
 (formerly known as Droid Mono),
 and core weights for the Noto Sans Mono font family.
 Beware that Noto Mono has a much smaller repertoire
 than Noto Sans or Noto Serif.
 .
 The name "Noto" is short for "No Tofu",
 describing the aim of covering all living Unicode scripts.
 .
 Tofu (豆腐) is Japanese jargon
 for unicode replacement character "�" (U+FFFD)
 often displayed as replacement for unassigned or unknown characters.</text>
